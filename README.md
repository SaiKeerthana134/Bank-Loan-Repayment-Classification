Bank Loan Repayment Classification using 

-> XGBoost 
-> Random Forest Classifier 
-> Logistic Regression 
The objective of this project is to minimize losses for the bank by classifying whether a loan will be fully repaid or charged off by the customer.
The ultimate goal is to provide the bank with accurate classifications that can help them make informed decisions about loan approvals, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies, ultimately reducing the number of loans that are charged off and optimizing the bank's loan portfolio performance. This project aims to contribute to the bank's risk management efforts and enhance its decision-making process related to loan issuances.
